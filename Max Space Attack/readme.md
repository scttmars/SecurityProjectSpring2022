# Max Space Attack

This attack generates a file that far exceeds the amount of space that accounts have. By running this script it will prevent the user from being able to
access their account since they have a file that exceeds the quota. This will only work on users that have write permissions turned on. The account listed
in the script was a testaccount used. Parts of this script were originally created to do a brute force dictionary attack but ended up generating files that
were too large.

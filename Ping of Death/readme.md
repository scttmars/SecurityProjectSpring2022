# Ping of Death

This script is a simple ping of death loop that was created as a shell script. It was used to test if the machines in the Department were vulnerable to this
DDoS attack. This does not work on newer machines but it was still attempted and did not work as expected. We do have some machines running on older operating
systems than Ubuntu 20 but it does not work on those machines either.
